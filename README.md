Code School's 'Staying Sharp with Angular' tutorial practice project

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.codeschool.com/">Code School</a>

Their (paid-only) 2nd tutorial on Angular.js, the follow-up to the free <a target="_blank" href="http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js/intro">Shaping Up With Angular</a>

So, I finished the first tutorial, in my cs-angular1 github project; now working through the follow-up/advanced tutorial, but also trying to implement the lessons in an actual working version of the website they mock-build in the tutorial.

This worked in the first tutorial.  Don't know yet if the same will hold true in this second tutorial.
